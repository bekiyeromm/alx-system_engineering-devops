# Learning Objectives
## At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
 - What is HTTPS SSL 2 main roles
 - What is the purpose encrypting traffic
 - What SSL termination means
 - Requirements
 - General
 - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 - All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 - All your files should end with a new line
 - A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 - All your Bash script files must be executable
 - Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error
 - The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
 - The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

# Your servers

Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Let’s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

## Requirements:

 - Add the subdomain www to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP (your domain name might be configured with default subdomains, feel free to remove them)
 - Add the subdomain lb-01 to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP
 - Add the subdomain web-01 to your domain, point it to your web-01 IP
 - Add the subdomain web-02 to your domain, point it to your web-02 IP
 - Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:
 - domain:
 - type: string
 - what: domain name to audit
 - mandatory: yes
 - subdomain:
 - type: string
 - what: specific subdomain to audit
 - mandatory: no
 - Output: The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION]
 - When only the parameter domain is provided, display information for its subdomains www, lb-01, web-01 and web-02 - in this specific order
 - When passing domain and subdomain parameters, display information for the specified subdomain
 - Ignore shellcheck case SC2086
 - Must use:
 - awk
 - at least one Bash function
 - You do not need to handle edge cases such as:
 - Empty parameters
 - Nonexistent domain names
 - Nonexistent subdomains
 - Example:

	sylvain@ubuntu$ dig www.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
	;; ANSWER SECTION:
	www.holberton.online.   87  IN  A   54.210.47.110
	sylvain@ubuntu$ dig lb-01.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
	;; ANSWER SECTION:
	lb-01.holberton.online. 101 IN  A   54.210.47.110
	sylvain@ubuntu$ dig web-01.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
	;; ANSWER SECTION:
	web-01.holberton.online. 212    IN  A   34.198.248.145
	sylvain@ubuntu$ dig web-02.holberton.online | grep -A1 'ANSWER SECTION:'
	;; ANSWER SECTION:
	web-02.holberton.online. 298    IN  A   54.89.38.100
	sylvain@ubuntu$
	sylvain@ubuntu$
	sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online
	The subdomain www is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
	The subdomain lb-01 is a A record and points to 54.210.47.110
	The subdomain web-01 is a A record and points to 34.198.248.145
	The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
	sylvain@ubuntu$
	sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-world_wide_web holberton.online web-02
	The subdomain web-02 is a A record and points to 54.89.38.100
	sylvain@ubuntu$

# 1. HAproxy SSL termination
# mandatory
“Terminating SSL on HAproxy” means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.

Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..

# Requirements:

 - HAproxy must be listening on port TCP 443
 - HAproxy must be accepting SSL traffic
 - HAproxy must serve encrypted traffic that will return the / of your web server
 - When querying the root of your domain name, the page returned must contain Holberton School
 - Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)
 - The file 1-haproxy_ssl_termination must be your HAproxy configuration file

 - Make sure to install HAproxy 1.5 or higher, SSL termination is not available before v1.5.

 - Example:

	sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI https://www.holberton.online
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

# 2. No loophole in your website traffic
# advanced
A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

# Requirements:

 - This should be transparent to the user
 - HAproxy should return a 301
 - HAproxy should redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS
 - Share your HAproxy config as an answer file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)
 - The file 100-redirect_http_to_https must be your HAproxy configuration file

Example:

	sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sIL http://www.holberton.online
	HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
	Content-length: 0
	Location: https://www.holberton.online/
	Connection: close

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
